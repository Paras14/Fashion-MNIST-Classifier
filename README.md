# Fashion-MNIST-Classifier

Trains a Multiclass classification model with images of clothes

First I have cleared data for noise and than randomise the sequence of it to eliminate selection bias. After checking a couple of images using matplotlib, a model is initialized and trained on the clean and randomized data.
The accuracy of the model is around 94%, which is checked on a test dataset taken aside from the training dataset
